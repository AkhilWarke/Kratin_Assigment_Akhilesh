## Problem Statement: How can you help Sunita Sharma (65+ years old) to live a healthier and better life? 
Identify one use case for elderly care (for the age group 65+) and create a working prototype to demonstrate your idea using technology known to you.

## My Solution
Android Application :- Health Maintainer

## Justification for the solution
People of age group 65+ not only suffer from physical distress but also mental distress, In today's fast moving world everyone is busy with their own life and the elderly are left with only limited interactions and small talks which can cause them to have mental distress. This is where the virtual companion comes to play, the elderly can talk to the bot without having to worry about running out of time and can feel the presence of someone listening to them. The bot is not only limited to this task but also can give medical advice for small medical problems which are time consuming if went to the doctor.
